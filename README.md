## Abstract

Models of impulsive heating in non-flaring active region loops have long predicted the
presence of faint, very hot (>4 MK) plasma, the so-called "smoking gun" of nanoflare
heating. Unambiguous observations of such plasma have remained elusive, due in part to
the sparsity of observations of high-temperature spectral lines, particularly in the soft X-
ray range. The Multi-Order X-ray Spectral Imager (MOXSI) aboard the CubeSat Imaging
X-Ray Solar Spectrometer (CubIXSS), to be launched in 2025, is a soft x-ray pinhole
imager that includes four filtergrams with passbands similar to the Al-poly and Be filters
on Hinode XRT as well as a slitless imaging spectrograph that will observe the entire
solar disk over the spectral range 1--60 Ã…. Because this range contains a number of key
high-temperature diagnostic lines, MOXSI is well-positioned to place unprecedented
constraints on this faint, hot plasma. In this poster, we present a series of full active region
simulations composed of many hundreds of impulsively heated loops with varying
amounts of very hot plasma as produced by low-frequency impulsive heating. From these
simulations, we forward model a series of MOXSI images, including the effect of the
dispersive grating, the point spread function, and other instrumental effects. Additionally,
we perform inversions of the resulting simulated slitless spectrograph data and compare
the resulting inverted emission measure distribution to the true emission measure
distribution. We demonstrate that MOXSI will be able to place tighter constraints on this
faint hot plasma than current observations allow, due primarily to its novel spectral range
and slitless design.
